### Frontend

- **React**: We chose React for its component-based architecture, making it easier to manage complex UI elements and data interactions within the dashboard.
- **Redux**: Redux provides a predictable state management system, allowing us to efficiently manage and update the application's global state, which is crucial for handling financial data.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript enhances the development process by providing static type checking and improved code readability, reducing errors and making maintenance smoother.
- **Recharts**: Recharts offers a simple and customizable way to create data visualizations, enabling us to present financial data in a clear and engaging manner.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Material-UI's pre-designed components and responsive design allow us to create a polished and user-friendly interface for the dashboard.

### Backend

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB offers a flexible and scalable database solution, allowing us to store and manage the financial data efficiently.
- **Express**: Express is a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js, providing a solid foundation for building the backend of the application.

#### Disclaimer: The backend components are maintained in a distinct repository, following a microservice architecture approach. https://github.com/chanychi/fundwiz-server/
